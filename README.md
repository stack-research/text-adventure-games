# LLM-Based Text Adventure Courses

This repository contains **learning courses delivered as LLM-based text adventures**.

Each course uses interactive narrative, role-based scenarios, and conversational decision-making so learners can practice real-world judgment in a guided environment. Instead of passive reading, learners progress by making choices, observing outcomes, and reflecting on tradeoffs.

The course format is designed for topics such as:
- security awareness and defensive reasoning
- software engineering and operational decision-making
- policy, risk, and governance tradeoffs
- incident analysis and response workflows

The goal is practical learning through simulation: turning complex ideas into hands-on experiences powered by language models.
