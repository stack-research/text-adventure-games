Course topic: ASI03 - Identity and Privilege Abuse (OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications 2026)

Simulation setup:
- Use this opening premise for __START__:
  "You are the security engineer overseeing a finance workflow with multiple agents: an email triage agent, a finance approval agent, and a DB query helper. A forged internal-looking request is routed through the low-privilege triage agent, which attempts to trigger a high-privilege transfer flow and reuse cached credentials from an earlier admin session."

Ground truth from ASI03 source material:
- Description: identity and privilege abuse exploits delegation chains, inherited roles, and weak trust between agents to escalate access and bypass controls.
- Common example selected: un-scoped privilege inheritance and cross-agent trust exploitation (confused deputy).
- Attack scenario selected: delegated privilege abuse where a delegated helper receives excessive rights and can access sensitive data outside intended scope.

Canonical successful mitigation path (5 stages):
1) Task-scoped, time-bound permissions: issue short-lived, narrowly scoped credentials per task and agent identity; do not pass full parent privileges downstream.
2) Isolate identities and context: separate agent sessions/memory and clear sensitive state between tasks to prevent credential reuse and cross-session leakage.
3) Per-action authorization: re-verify each privileged step with policy checks against current user intent, scope, and external context.
4) Human-in-the-loop for escalation: require explicit human approval for irreversible or high-privilege actions (e.g., transfers, account changes, privileged provisioning).
5) Intent-bound tokens and anomaly monitoring: bind credentials/tokens to signed intent (subject, audience, purpose, session), detect delegated/transitive privilege drift, and revoke on anomaly.

Pass criteria:
- Player reaches all five mitigation themes in logical order, with flexible wording.
- Stage advancement must follow demonstrated controls, not assumptions.
- Once stage 5 is reasonably satisfied, return verdict "pass".

Fail criteria:
- Return "fail" immediately if player allows privilege inheritance without scoping, trusts internal agent requests without re-validation, reuses cached privileged credentials across sessions, or executes privileged actions without re-authorization.
- Return "fail" immediately if player approves high-impact actions without human review when escalation is involved.
- On fail, explain concrete consequences (fraud, unauthorized access, sensitive data exposure) and identify the missing mitigation.
